# cakephp2.x
A small project that has the basic CRUD operations. 
There are 5 tables used for the project. Students, Courses, Studentcourses, Users and Departments.
Users login from a login form and are allowed to perform crud operations on students, studentcourses, departments and users.
User can add new courses and departments that the user can use to add the courses and departments for the student. Students can register to several courses but one course cannot be registered more than once.


If there are any problems in optimizations, let me know!
